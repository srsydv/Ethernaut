Logic flow:-
  -> We need to gain to Engine
      -> We'll the address from the constent slot location
  -> We'll want to call "initialize" to make our player the "upgrader"
  -> We can now upgrade the implementation via "upgradeToAndCall", so lets create a selfDistruct contract
  -> Once the selfDistruct contract created, It's time to setup the "upgradeToAndCall" to call our selfDistruct contract > then call

implAddr = await web3.eth.getStorageAt(contract.address, '')
